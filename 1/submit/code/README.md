Datasets/proj1_data_cleaning.py: Preprocessing Dataset

models/myutility.py: Implement One-shot encoding

models/naivebayes.py: Implement Naive Bayes model

models/logistic.py: Implement Logistic Regression model

tests/metric_eval.py: calculate precision, recall and  f1-score  (for question 1 and bonus) 

tests/stoppingcrit.py: evalute different stopping threholds' effct on accuracy (for bonus)

tests/accvsiter.py: Use a threshold for change in the value of the cost function as termination criteria, and plot the accuracy on train/validation set as a function of iterations of gradient descent (for question 2)

tests/lr.py: evaluate the learning rate 's effect on accuracy, for hyperparameter search (for bonus)

test/sizedata.py: evaluate the number of sample's effect on  accuracy (for question 3)

# COMP551-project

main.py: prediction accuracy based on four data sets using sklearn and our model (for question 1 and bonus) 

metric_eval.py: calculate precision, recall and  f1-score  (for question 1 and bonus) 

stoppingcrit.py: evalute different stopping threholds' effct on accuracy (for bonus)

accvsiter.py: Use a threshold for change in the value of the cost function as termination criteria, and plot the accuracy on train/validation set as a function of iterations of gradient descent (for question 2)

lr.py: evaluate the learning rate 's effect on accuracy, for hyperparameter search (for bonus)

sizedata.py: evaluate the number of sample's effect on  accuracy (for question 3)
